# WAPF Extended 3.1.5 source audit

Audit snapshot: 2026-09-30. The installed WAPF Extended package reports
version 3.1.5 in both its plugin header and the live WordPress plugin
registry; it was inactive during this read-only audit. Its package bundles
the Pro core plus Extended and linked-product controllers. The installed
directory contains 156 files, including 120 PHP files. No activation or
production behavior is inferred from static source.

Studio Wombat describes Extended as Pro plus Cards, linked Products,
Calculation, image swatches with quantities, extra formula functions, date
restrictions, weight changes, and enlarged image swatches. “Extended +
Addons” is a separate bundle that adds current and future add-ons; six
separate add-ons are tracked separately in the [full capability
ledger](WAPF-CAPABILITY-LEDGER.md).

## Extended capability inventory

| Capability IDs in ledger | Installed 3.1.5 source | Audited source behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `WAPF-DATE-DYNAMIC-BOUNDS`, `WAPF-DATE-WEEKDAYS`, `WAPF-DATE-DISABLED-DATES`, `WAPF-DATE-CUTOFF` | `includes/controllers/class-extended-controller.php`, `extend/date.php`, `includes/classes/class-helper.php`, `includes/classes/class-cart.php`, `assets/js/extended.min.js`, `views/frontend/fields/date.php` | Options are `min_date`, `max_date`, `disabled_days`, `disabled_dates`, and `disable_today_after`. Bounds accept y/m/d offsets and references to another date field. Blackouts accept exact dates, recurring MM-DD dates, and inclusive ranges. The frontend receives corresponding data attributes; the server validation filter enforces blackouts, weekdays, bounds, and same-day cutoff. Display format is the global `wapf_date_format` option, default `mm-dd-yyyy`. |
| `WAPF-DATE-WEEK-START` | `assets/js/datepicker.min.js`; date configuration in `includes/controllers/class-extended-controller.php` | The installed Extended PHP settings do not expose a WordPress `start_of_week` option. OPF's configured-week-start support is an additional behavior, not a WAPF setting. |
| `WAPF-FIELD-CARDS`, `WAPF-FIELD-CARDS-MAIN-IMAGE` | `includes/classes/class-config.php`, `includes/classes/class-html.php`, `includes/controllers/class-product-controller.php`, `assets/js/frontend.min.js` | `card` is a selectable, multi-choice field with choice pricing and appearance settings. Changelog v3.1 adds card-driven main-image switching. |
| `WAPF-FIELD-CHILD-PRODUCTS`, `WAPF-FIELD-CHILD-PRODUCTS-CATEGORY-PRICE-TYPE` | `includes/controllers/class-linked-products-controller.php`, `includes/classes/class-fields.php`, `includes/classes/class-cart.php`, `includes/classes/class-html.php`, `includes/classes/class-woocommerce-service.php`, `includes/controllers/class-product-controller.php` | The Products field stores `product_selection`, `product_query`, presentation subtype, selected products, quantity settings, selection bounds, and optional display slots. Category query `pricing_type` accepts `fixed` (default) or `none`; `none` sets the child line price to zero. Quantity selectors price from child quantity. Selected children become Woo cart/order lines; source hooks validate stock, synchronize quantity/removal, update stock, extend Store API data, persist parent-child order metadata, and restore order-again links. Changelog v3.0.8 adds category price type and caps category results at 50. |
| `WAPF-FIELD-CALCULATION` | `includes/controllers/class-extended-controller.php`, `includes/classes/class-config.php`, `includes/classes/class-fields.php`, `includes/classes/class-html.php`, `includes/controllers/class-public-controller.php`, `views/frontend/fields/calc.php`, `extend/formulas.php` | Field type `calc` stores `calc_type` (`default` informational or `cost` pricing), `formula`, `result_format`, and `result_text`. Cost calculations enter normal formula pricing. Changelog v3.1 allows calculations in other fields' conditionals. |
| `WAPF-FIELD-IMAGE-QUANTITIES`, `WAPF-FIELD-IMAGE-QUANTITY-ZOOM`, `WAPF-FIELD-SWATCH-IMAGE-ZOOM`, `WAPF-FIELD-CHILD-PRODUCTS-IMAGE-ZOOM` | `includes/classes/class-config.php`, `includes/classes/class-html.php`, `includes/classes/class-fields.php`, `includes/controllers/class-linked-products-controller.php`, `assets/js/frontend.min.js` | `image-swatch-qty` is a single-choice image field with quantity input and quantity-based pricing. `large_image` enables an enlarged choice image; markup exposes `data-zoom-url` for frontend behavior. Linked-product cards have independent image and display settings. |
| `WAPF-PRICE-FORMULA-WEIGHT`, `WAPF-COMMERCE-WEIGHT` | `includes/controllers/class-extended-controller.php`, `includes/classes/class-fields.php`, `includes/classes/class-cart.php`, `includes/controllers/class-linked-products-controller.php` | Field and choice settings store `weight`; quantity fields can store weight per quantity. Before Woo totals, selected values are resolved against the source field group and weight expressions accept `[qty]` and `[x]`. Values use WooCommerce's configured weight unit; linked products retain their own product weight. |
| `WAPF-PRICE-FORMULA-ADVANCED`, `WAPF-PRICE-FORMULA-TEXT-COMPARE`, `WAPF-PRICE-FORMULA-CHECKED`, `WAPF-PRICE-FORMULA-FIELD-STATE`, `WAPF-PRICE-FORMULA-SUM-QTY`, `WAPF-PRICE-FORMULA-TRIG`, `WAPF-PRICE-FORMULA-DATE`, `WAPF-PRICE-FORMULA-DOW`, `WAPF-PRICE-FORMULA-MONTH`, `WAPF-PRICE-FORMULA-CUSTOM-VARIABLE` | `includes/controllers/class-public-controller.php`, `includes/classes/class-config.php`, `includes/classes/class-helper.php`, `includes/classes/class-fields.php`, `includes/classes/class-field-groups.php`, `extend/formulas.php`, `extend/date.php`, `views/admin/variable-builder.php` | Core supplies `min`, `max`, `len`, and `lookuptable`; Extended registers `round`, `abs`, `floor`, `ceil`, `sqrt`, `cos`, `sin`, `tan`, `pow`, `sumQty`, `checked`, `files`, `if`, `or`, `and`, plus `today`, `datediff`, `dow`, and `month`. Formula arguments are semicolon-delimited; formula text comparisons are unquoted; `checked`, `files`, and `sumQty` take field IDs. Saved groups carry formula definitions and custom variables. PHP runtime and public formula-definition metadata are both in scope. |

These findings seed the Extended entries in the [capability
ledger](WAPF-CAPABILITY-LEDGER.md). This source audit does not claim OPF
parity; implementation, import, and commerce evidence must be established
separately for each capability. Pro is included because the Extended edition
bundles it. Six separately sold add-ons and compatibility entries remain
tracked separately and are outside this edition's 1.0 parity gate.

## Current target version gap

This document audits the installed 3.1.5 package only. The current official
Extended changelog now lists 3.2.1, released 27 June 2026. The live site's
inactive 3.1.5 copy is a useful source baseline, but it cannot establish current
target behavior by itself. The 3.2.1 distribution source is not present in the
audited installation, so source-level review of the intervening releases is
still open. Do not use the 3.1.5 audit as the source-audit exit gate.

The official changelog delta that must be reconciled into the ledger is:

| Version | Published capability or behavior changes | Audit implications |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3.1.6 | Cards with quantity inputs gained additional conditional-logic options; select tax handling was fixed | Inspect card quantity condition controls and saved settings, then compare selected-option tax behavior |
| 3.1.7 | Upload and order-admin deletion security hardening; text-swatch corner-radius persistence fix; informational calculation result-format fix; modern uploader enabled by default | Inspect upload and order-admin authorization, corner-radius serialization, calculation result formatting, and uploader defaults |
| 3.2 | True/false and checkbox switch presentation; checkbox columns; field-group title search; number step and whole/decimal validation; formula weight; styled-control accessibility; negative options-total formatting; active product-type condition filtering; upload validation fix | Inspect setting keys/defaults, server validation, formula-weight parsing, keyboard/screen-reader behavior, and the admin query/filter contract |
| Extended 3.2.1 | Image zoom for image+quantity and linked-product image fields; date-picker accessibility; disabled-days save fix; option-discount tax fix | Inspect zoom controls/data, date control semantics and persistence, and option-tax calculations |
| Pro 3.2.2 | Fixed a blank Product Fields admin page | Extended includes Pro features, but the versioned Extended package source must establish whether this Pro patch is bundled |

and [official edition comparison](https://www.studiowombat.com/knowledge-base/whats-the-difference-between-each-version/).
The edition comparison confirms Extended includes Pro; the audit gate therefore
covers both Pro-core and Extended-only behavior. Pro's latest changelog is
3.2.2 while Extended's is 3.2.1, so exact package inclusion is an open
source-audit question. Six separately sold add-ons remain out of this scope.
This is a changelog-based release-delta review, not source-level verification
of the current 3.2.1/3.2.2 packages.
